* Added this Changelog file.

vmcatcher-0.1.1

* Better documentation 
* Fix an uncaught exception for failing to verify messages.

vmcatcher-0.1.0

* Data base schema has changed adding a new table ImageDefinition and 
   renaming or tables and field for constancy reasons.
* Images are now selected to be cached. (reason 1 for new table)
    '-a', '--add' and '-r', '--remove' options added to vmcatcher_image.
* When subscribing to an image list the imagelists images UUID's are 
    registered to the subscription, all UUID's that clash in a later 
    added subscriptions will be ignored. All image UUID's that are not 
    registered for a subscription will be ignored, and an error message
    will be logged. (reason 2 for new table)
* New format of cache.index files. Allowing better tracking of images 
    without accessing DB. (old format had issues with expiring images)
* Made a class for each cache directory, inheriting from a base class.
    (easier maintenance)
* Clearly logging all defaulted command line values. 
    (hopefully easier to use/support.)
* Allowing cache management to do separate tasks of downloading, 
    check sum testing and expiring. 
    (You might want to check the check sums more frequently)
* Renamed the default database from "tutorial.db" to
    "vmcatcher.db" (To avoid people trying to use old DB with new
    code).
* Renamed "image.dc:identifier" field on image queries to 
    "imagedef.dc:identifier" as this is in my opinion more clear.
* Removed "imagelist.authorised" from image queries as it was
    misleading.
* Added 'imagedef.cache' to image queries so you know if image is
    cached.
* Added more information to image information including,
    'image.dc:description', 'image.dc:title', 'image.hv:hypervisor',
    'image.hv:size', 'image.hv:uri', 'image.hv:version', 'image.sl:arch',
    'image.sl:checksum', 'image.sl:comments', 'image.sl:os',
    'image.sl:osversion' This is to make image selection easier.
* Removed 'sha512' from general image listing as images may not be
    available so may not have a current hash, you can still find an image
    UUID by 'sha512'.
* Fixed bug about expiring images immediately rather than on second
    DB update.
* Changed 'imagelist.authorised' to 'imagelist.expired' for
    subscription queries, as previous title was misleading.
* Images listing now shows all images assigned to a subscription, 
    rather than available images, images now have a state number, this 
    is a bitmask in a way similar to directory permissions in UNIX.
    1 == should be cached. 2 == Available, hence images with status 3 
    will be cached.

vmcatcher-0.0.15

* Changes to handle differences in python 2.4 (SL5) and python 2.6
    (SL6) url parsing libraries.
* Cleaner error handling and spelling correction stating clearly if the
    file fails to verify, by size or sha512, rather than always stating size.

vmcatcher-0.0.14

* Improved error message when images pass disk space limit.
* Support https as a image download format (being used by CERN VM).
* Catch exception correctly for corrupted signed images lists.

vmcatcher-0.0.13

* More robust to image lists with data that does not pass
  validation. No new features have been added.
